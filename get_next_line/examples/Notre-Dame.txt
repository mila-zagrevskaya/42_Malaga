It was then, as it is to-day, an irregular trapezoid,
bordered on one side by the quay, and on the other three by a series of lofty, narrow, and gloomy houses.
By day, one could admire the variety of its edifices, all sculptured in stone or wood, and already presenting complete
specimens of the different domestic architectures of the Middle Ages, running back from the fifteenth to the eleventh century,
from the casement which had begun to dethrone the arch, to the Roman semicircle, which had been supplanted by the ogive, and
which still occupies, below it, the first story of that ancient house de la Tour Roland, at the corner of the Place upon the Seine,
on the side of the street with the Tannerie. At night, one could distinguish nothing of all that mass of buildings,
except the black indentation of the roofs, unrolling their chain of acute angles round the place; for one of the radical
differences between the cities of that time, and the cities of the present day, lay in the fa√ßades which looked upon the places
and streets, and which were then gables. For the last two centuries the houses have been turned round.
