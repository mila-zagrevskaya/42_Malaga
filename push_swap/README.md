# push_swap


Generate 100 random values using shuf.
Run the push_swap program with the random values and capture the instructions.
Count the size of the instruction list using wc -l to get the number of instructions:

ARG=$(shuf -i 1-1000 -n 100 | tr '\n' ' '); INSTRUCTIONS=$(./push_swap $ARG); echo "$INSTRUCTIONS" | ./checker_linux $ARG; echo "$INSTRUCTIONS" | wc -l


This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible nbr of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various types of algo and choose the most appropriate solu for an optimized data sorting
